# Dotfiles

## Setup

```shell
./setup.sh [work|personal]
```

## Pre Installation

### WSL 2

- Download/Install Ubuntu, VcXsrv, and your favorite font type
- Fix VcXsrv firewall settings to be allowed over public networks
- Make changes to settings\*.json if needed (fonts, image background. etc...)
- Restart

## Post Installation

- Based on your terminal, you may need to set the font accordingly inside the terminal options. I need to find a way to do this automatically.
- Launch Docker Desktop if running on Windows or Mac

### Emacs

- install nerd fonts with `M-x nerd-icons-install-fonts`
- init vterm

## TODO

- make versions adjustable for python, node, emacs etc
- use tree-sitter built in packages to manage installs
- embark use in emacs
